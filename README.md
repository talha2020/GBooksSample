# Google books exercise for Senior Android Developer position at Recolor

As instructed, I haven't spent a lot of time on design and handling all the edge cases. In most cases, i mentioned it in the code.
Also note that this is the first time I've used Dagger in any project, wanted to use it for a while so used this exercise as an opportunity 
to work on it. So implementation regarding Dagger may be not fully optimal.
